# Student Mark Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts student marks
based on study hours. The trained model is deployed using a Flask web framework.

---

## 📌 Project Description
The purpose of this project is to predict the percentage of marks a student may score
based on the number of hours they study per day. A machine learning model is trained
and integrated into a Flask web application for real-time prediction.

## ⚙️ How the Application Works
1. User enters the number of study hours.
2. The input is sent to the Flask backend.
3. The trained ML model predicts the marks.
4. The predicted result is displayed on the web page.
5. Input and output data are stored in a CSV file.
